#THIS REPO IS A CLONE
--------------------
E. Potter adapted and expanded my code for extracting dynamical tendency terms for WRF v3.2 to be compatible with v3.8. Additional improvements are summarized in https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/1737/2020/

This clone is from: https://github.com/Empott/WRF-momentum-and-temperature-budget-variables
E.Potter's original README is below:
 
# WRF-momentum-and-temperature-budget-variables
This repository contains all the WRF modifications to output the momentum budget variables used in "Dynamical drivers of the local wind regime in a Himalayan valley". 
These modifications are adapted from those used by N. Moisseeva: https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/33426/1.0107646/1
The document above also contains clear instructions on how to use the modified WRF code.
